Contact me - jlawrenc@cpan.org - to have me add things to my Net::vCard todo list. :)

0 - N and ADR

 Make N and ADR return objects of Net::vCard::N and Net::vCard::ADR respectively

1 - UTF-16

 Apple's Evil Address Book can suddenly decide to poop out UTF-16. I don't know how to deal with that yet.

2 - get/set methods

 Right now we're just twiddling data in the hash - formal get/set methods created via AUTOLOAD is a better idea.

3 - print methods

 The reverse of the load_ methods

4 - printFile

 Naturally this will print out all the objects to a file via the print_ methods. :)
